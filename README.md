Web JS Auctioneer Game

## About
I built this app because I felt that it allowed me to practice many different problem solving techniques. The entire app is built without the help of any UI or component libraries in order to allow me to thoroughly practice solving issues without a crutch to lean on.

It implements things like:
--- Countdown timers
---Randomization to bots (ie.. which bots will vote on current item, what their max bid for that item will be, how much their current bid is, or whether or not they will even bid any longer.)
---Conditional UI rendering
---Continuous bidding wars will be created using a Web Worker (Multi-Threading). This is something new that I am working on learning and will be the biggest take away from this project.
---Sharpening my Redux state management skills


##Specs
---Built with React and Redux
---Heavy use of styled components
---Web Workers for Multi-Threading
